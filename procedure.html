          <h3>Client</h3>
          <p>Client starts by parsing the input file, each line of the file is considered as a request. for each request it formats a packet based on what is required by the protocol and what data is given. Client the sends the packet to the server and waits for a response, once the client receives a response it parses the packet for and formats the output string and prints it out. Client then moves on to next request</p>

          <h3>Server (Unoptimized)</h3>
          <p>Server will have a main thread that is constantly waiting for new conections, for each new connection it creates a new thread and passes that connection to the thread. The thread will receive packets containing requests from the connected client. The server will search for the ASN of the IP or ORG in a database, then the server will use that ASN to lookup in another database ethier the IP or the ORG basesd on what is requested. server will then format a packet containing the response and send it to the client </p>
