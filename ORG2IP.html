          <h3>What Are ASNs</h3>
        	<p>
						Autonomous Systems (AS) can be most simply described as a group of IP prefixes that follow their own routing policy within the system. These play an important role in the network layer, with the Internet being viewed as a collection of these systems. AS Numbers (ASN) are simply the numbers used to manage routing within their network, and to exchange information with other ASes. These numbers are allocated by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) on the basis that the AS meets certain qualifications put in place by governing bodies.
