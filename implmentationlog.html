					The initial implementation for this project is a simple C program that can be used for single, current IP to organization attribution. This implementation makes use of datasets provided by the Center for Applied Internet Data Analysis (CAIDA), which includes data for IP prefix to ASN attribution, as well as ASN to organization attribution. To simplify things, this program only focuses on taking in user input, and obtaining data from CAIDA through simple API calls. Along with this, the current implementation forgoes the client-server model, with the primary focus being the general procedure from IP address to Organization Information. Provided below is a short clip showcasing usage of this program. We hope this will provide a benchmark to look back on in further implementations, showcasing the many improvements and optimizations available to make for this program.
